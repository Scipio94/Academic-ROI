# iReady A-ROI
Analysis of academic results in comparison to the cost of academic resources to calculate the academic return on investment (A-ROI)

## Abstract
During the 2022-2023 academic school year Foundation Academies’ academic team established English Language Arts (ELA) as priority focus with the intention of increasing ELA proficiency on local and standardized state assessments. To achieve this goal Foundation Academies utilized iReady, a K-12 adaptive educational program that offers personalized intervention in ELA and math. It uses diagnostic assessments to identify learning gaps and provides targeted lessons and activities to fill students' individual academic gaps. iReady is most effective for grades K-8. With that being said, there is a cost associated with using iReady’s products and resources. The purpose of this analysis is to evaluate the academic return on investment (A-ROI), the value or benefit a student or institution receives in relation to the financial investment made in education, based on iReady diagnostic performance of a cohort of students in grades K-8 throughout the academic school year.

## Variables

Variables
There are several variables that will affect the outcome of the analysis:

- **A-ROI**: Value or benefit a student or institution receives in relation to the financial investment made in education.
  
- **Overall Relative Placement**: The result of an iReady Diagnostic in relation to a student’s grade level.
  - Mid or Above Grade Level
  - Early On Grade Level 
  - 1 Grade Level Below	
  - 2 Grade Levels Below
  - 3 or More Grade Levels Below
 
- **Tiers**: Grouping of students for intervention based on their overall relative placement.
  - Tier 1
    - Mid or Above Grade Level
    - Early On Grade Level 
  - Tier 2
    - 1 Grade Level Below	
- Tier 3
    - 2 Grade Levels Below
    - 3 or More Grade Levels Below

- **Student Grade**: Student grade level

## Objective 

The objective of this analysis is to calculate the A-ROI for iReady based on the ELA academic priority focus at Foundation Academies. The analysis will be guided by the following questions:

1. How many  K-8 students were in Tier 2 after the first iReady diagnostic?
2. How many students in the original K-8 Tier 2 cohort achieved Tier 1 status?
3. What was the A-ROI of iReady?

## Analysis

1. How many  K-8 students were in Tier 2 after the first iReady diagnostic?

During the 2022-2023 academic school year there was a priority focus on increasing proficiency in ELA on local and state assessments using iReady. The academic team sought to achieve their priority focus by moving students from Tier 2 to Tier 1 in ELA based on their iReady diagnostic results in grades K-8. After the initial iReady diagnostic there were a total of 283 K-8 students in Tier 2. 1st grade had the most students in Tier 2, 64 students, and 7th grade had the least amount of students in Tier 2, 13. 

2. How many students in the original K-8 Tier 2 cohort achieved Tier 1 status?

Following the final iReady diagnostic 222 students, 78%, of students moved into Tier 1, 35 students, 12%, remained in Tier 2, 21 students, 7%, fell to Tier 3, and 5 students, 2%, did not test. 

3. What was the A-ROI of iReady?

The A-ROI is calculated by dividing the academic outcome, percentage of students that achieved Tier 1 status, by the cost of iReady resources per student. The quotient will be the average expected increase per dollar spent.

The cost of the iReady resources for K-8 was $20,757.50 for a cohort of 283 K-8 students that were Tier 2 following the initial iReady diagnostic, a cost of $73.35 per student. The goal of the priority focus was to move these students into Tier 1. Following the final iReady diagnostic 222 students, 78 %, of students were in Tier 1. If you divide the percentage of students that achieved Tier 1 status with the K-8 Tier 2 cohort by the cost per student 1.06 you’d get a quotient of 1.06, meaning that for every dollar spent Foundation Academy can expect to see approximately a 1% increase in the percentage of students in Tier 1. 

## Conclusion

The implementation of iReady resources by the Foundation Academies’ academic team to achieve their priority focus in ELA was successful. 78%, 222, of the students in the original K-8 Tier 2 cohort following the initial iReady diagnostic moved into Tier 1. Additionally, there was a positive fiscal return, for every dollar spent on iReady resources there can be an expected increase of approximately 1% in the percentage of students in Tier 1 on average.
